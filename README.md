## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had more practice using the display grid. And Iâ€™m getting the hang of it. I also got to use my first CSS animation. I set up classes to be able to fade up and fade down, then applied to change with the breakpoints.

```css
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes fadeInDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to use the display grid to make my layouts more responsive. I will get more practice using CSS animations. And how I can include them in my future projects. I will get better at writing CSS code.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is always useful. I was able to get a refresher of the display grid. I learned how to set up my columns and rows. I also learned how to make a fade in and fade out animation, using keyframes.
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.co/) - Stackoverflow is always helpful. I looked up some display grid examples.
